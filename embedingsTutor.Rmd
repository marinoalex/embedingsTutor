## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(widyr)

load(url("https://cbail.github.io/Elected_Official_Tweets.Rdata"))
elected_no_retweets <- elected_official_tweets %>%
  filter(is_retweet == F) %>%
  select(c("text"))

#create tweet id
elected_no_retweets$postID<-row.names(elected_no_retweets)
head(elected_no_retweets)

#create context window with length 8
tidy_skipgrams <- elected_no_retweets %>%
  unnest_tokens(ngram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 8) %>%
  mutate(ngramID = row_number()) %>% 
  tidyr::unite(skipgramID, postID, ngramID) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, ngram)

#calculate unigram probabilities (used to normalize skipgram probabilities later)
unigram_probs <- elected_no_retweets %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))


#calculate probabilities
skipgram_probs <- tidy_skipgrams %>%
  pairwise_count(word, skipgramID, diag = TRUE, sort = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(p = n / sum(n))

#normalize probabilities
normalized_prob <- skipgram_probs %>%
  filter(n > 20) %>%
  rename(word1 = item1, word2 = item2) %>%
  left_join(unigram_probs %>%
              select(word1 = word, p1 = p),
            by = "word1") %>%
  left_join(unigram_probs %>%
              select(word2 = word, p2 = p),
            by = "word2") %>%
  mutate(p_together = p / p1 / p2)


normalized_prob[2005:2010,]

normalized_prob %>% 
    filter(word1 == "trump") %>%
    arrange(-p_together)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
